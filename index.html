<p><img id="self-portrait" src="IMG_0261Medium.jpg" alt="Picture of Joe">I am currently a senior at Michigan State University working towards my
degree in Information Science at the College of Communication arts and sciences. Along with my undergraduate degree, I have been accepted
in to the linked Bachelors-Masters program in Media and Information with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction. </p>

<p>While I work on obtaining my masters degree I hope to further increase my web development skills along with becoming a better UX researcher
    and designer. Navigate through my portfolio to learn more about my coursework at Michigan State along with learning more about me and some of the 
projects that I have worked on during my time at Michigan State. </p>

<p><img id="web-dev" src="webdevpic.png" alt="Web devopement">As a technology fan, my studies in web development and User experience and User interface design
have been fun to study during my time at Michigan State University. In fact these areas of study really go hand in hand. I believe having a discipline in both web development 
and creating human-centered designs will allow me to be an asset in the industry.  </p>

<p>I would like to work as either a web developer or as a UX researcher, UX designer, Experience Designer, or Interaction Designer. </p>
